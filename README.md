# my-better-t-app

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Self, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/web/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the fullstack application.

## Qwen Image

The image studio supports `qwen-image-2.0-pro` through the native DashScope synchronous API.
Add the following variables to `apps/web/.env`:

```bash
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
# Optional. Defaults to the Beijing endpoint:
DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com
```

Beijing and Singapore API keys cannot be mixed. For Singapore, use
`https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`; a workspace-specific Model Studio domain can also be
provided as the base URL.

## Voice Design

The authenticated `/voice-design` route creates custom Qwen-TTS or CosyVoice voices from a
natural-language description and returns a playable preview plus the reusable voice ID. It
reuses `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`.

Qwen-TTS voice creation may be billed per successful voice. CosyVoice creation is free but is
available only in the Beijing region. For the widest model support, configure the
workspace-specific Model Studio domain as `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@my-better-t-app/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment
